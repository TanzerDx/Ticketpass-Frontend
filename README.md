## 📺 Overview

I developed **Ticketpass** as a personal learning project, building both the frontend and backend from scratch using **React.js**, **Spring Boot**, and **MySQL**.  

The application implements essential features such as:

- 🔐 **User authentication** – secure login and registration  
- 🎫 **Ticket management** – browse, purchase, and view tickets  
- 💾 **Data persistence** – reliable storage and retrieval with MySQL  

The project focuses on clean architecture, maintainable code, and security best practices.  
> ⚠️ Since this is a personal project, it is not publicly hosted online.
